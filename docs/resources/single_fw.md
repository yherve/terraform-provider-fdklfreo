        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the
        value for Allowed SYNs per Second is 10000, the Burst Size must be at least 1000.</li>

- **interface_id** (String) The Interface ID automatically maps to a physical network
        port of the same number during the initial configuration of the
        engine, but the mapping can be changed as necessary
        through the engineâs command line interface.<br/>
        In case of VLAN Physical Interface:<br/>
        Enter the VLAN ID (1-4094). The VLAN IDs you add must be the same as the VLAN
        IDs that are used in the switch at the other end of the VLAN trunk.

- **key** (Number) The associated key of the element.<br>
        Required for element update but not for creation.
- **log_moderation** (Block List) You can also configure Log Compression to save resources on the engine. By default, each
generated Antispoofing and Discard log entry is logged separately and displayed as a separate
entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the
generated Antispoofing log entries or Discard log entries. After this, logging returns to normal
and all the generated entries are once more logged and displayed separately. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--adsl_interface--log_moderation))

        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you
        defined. This happens even if there are no bandwidth limits or
        guarantees defined for any traffic.
        <br/>

        number of Allowed SYNs per Second (the number of allowed SYN packets per second)
        and the Burst Size (the number of allowed SYNs before the engine starts limiting the
        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the
        value for Allowed SYNs per Second is 10000, the Burst Size must be at least 1000.</li>
        </ul>

entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the
generated Antispoofing log entries or Discard log entries. After this, logging returns to normal

and the Inline Interface. Layer 2 Firewalls only have Inline Interfaces for traffic
inspection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--modem_interface--node_interface))
- **other_configuration_flag** (Boolean) Other configuration (if IPv6 Router Advertisements)?<br/>
        The Firewall offers other configuration information, such as DNSrelated
        information or information on other servers within the

        Not Required.
- **override_engine_settings** (Boolean) Override Engine's Default Settings flag
        <br/>Not Required.
- **override_log_moderation_settings** (Boolean) Log Moderation override flag
        <br/>Not Required.
- **qos_limit** (Number) Enter the throughput for the link on this interface as kilobits
        per second <i>(for example, 2048)</i>. The same throughput is
        automatically applied to any VLANs created under this
        Physical Interface.<br/>
        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you
        defined. This happens even if there are no bandwidth limits or
        guarantees defined for any traffic.
        <br/>

        QoS is selected as the QoS Mode, the Throughput must also
        be defined.<br/>
        The same QoS Mode is automatically applied to any VLANs
        created under this Physical Interface.
        <br/>
        Not Required.
- **qos_policy_ref** (String) The QoS Policy for the link on this interface.<br/>

        <ul>
        <li><code>off</code>: SYN Rate Limits are disabled. This is the default setting.</li>
        <li><code>auto</code>: This is the recommended mode. The engine automatically calculates the
        number of Allowed SYNs per Second (the number of allowed SYN packets per second)
        and the Burst Size (the number of allowed SYNs before the engine starts limiting the
        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the
        value for Allowed SYNs per Second is 10000, the Burst Size must be at least 1000.</li>

        purposes on any of the network interfaces.
        <br>
        <b>Required.</b>
- **sync_mode** (String) Defines how the nodes exchange information about the traffic that they
        process:
        <ul>
        <li><code>sync_all</code>: (recommended) Both full and incremental synchronization messages are
        sent. This allows frequent updates without consuming resources excessively.
        Regular full synchronization ensures that all nodes stay synchronized even if
        some incremental messages are not delivered.</li>
        <li><code>sync_full</code>: (not recommended) Only full synchronization messages are sent.
        Incremental updates are not sent in between, so nodes may not have the
        same information on connections unless the full sync interval is significantly
        reduced.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Required.</b>
- **sync_security** (String) The Synchronization Security Level:
        <ul>
        <li><code>none</code>: no security features. Do not select this options unless the heartbeat
        traffic uses a dedicated, secure network that does not handle other traffic.
        </li>
        <li><code>sign</code>: (default) transmissions are authenticated to prevent outside injections
        of connection state information.
        </li>
        <li><code>encrypt</code>: transmissions are authenticated and encrypted. This
        option increases the overhead compared to the default option, but is strongly
        recommended if the node-to-node communications are relayed through
        insecure networks (for example, if the backup heartbeat is configured on an
        interface that handles other traffic).
        </li>
        </ul>
        Required.

VLAN. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--switch_interface--dhcp_relay))
- **dhcp_server_on_interface** (Block List) Single Firewalls and Firewall Clusters have an integrated DHCP server that can be set up
independently on several Physical Interfaces and VLAN Interfaces. When VLAN Interfaces are
configured, the DHCP server must be set up separately for each VLAN. Only IPv4 addresses are

- **interface_id** (String) The Interface ID automatically maps to a physical network
        port of the same number during the initial configuration of the
        engine, but the mapping can be changed as necessary
        through the engineâs command line interface.<br/>
        In case of VLAN Physical Interface:<br/>
        Enter the VLAN ID (1-4094). The VLAN IDs you add must be the same as the VLAN
        IDs that are used in the switch at the other end of the VLAN trunk.

        for Interface ID 2 and VLAN ID 100.</i>
        <br/>
        In case of Switch /Port Group interfaces, the interface ID must be prefixed by "SWP_". For example, for switch ID 1 and Port Group ID 1.2 you must enter SWP_1 for the switch and SWP_1.2 for the Port Group.

- **key** (Number) The associated key of the element.<br>
        Required for element update but not for creation.
- **log_moderation** (Block List) You can also configure Log Compression to save resources on the engine. By default, each
generated Antispoofing and Discard log entry is logged separately and displayed as a separate
entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the
generated Antispoofing log entries or Discard log entries. After this, logging returns to normal
and all the generated entries are once more logged and displayed separately. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--switch_interface--log_moderation))

in Firewall Clusters, IPS engines, and Layer 2 Firewalls. Firewall Clusters use a
second type of interface, Cluster Virtual IP Address (CVI), for operative traffic.
IPS engines have two types of interfaces for traffic inspection: the Capture Interface
and the Inline Interface. Layer 2 Firewalls only have Inline Interfaces for traffic
inspection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--switch_interface--node_interface))
- **other_configuration_flag** (Boolean) Other configuration (if IPv6 Router Advertisements)?<br/>

        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you
        defined. This happens even if there are no bandwidth limits or
        guarantees defined for any traffic.
        <br/>
        Not Required.
- **qos_mode** (String) Defines how QoS is applied to the link on this interface.<br/>
        If Full QoS or DSCP Handling and Throttling is selected as

        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the

- **log_moderation** (Block List) You can also configure Log Compression to save resources on the engine. By default, each
generated Antispoofing and Discard log entry is logged separately and displayed as a separate
entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the
generated Antispoofing log entries or Discard log entries. After this, logging returns to normal

        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you
        defined. This happens even if there are no bandwidth limits or
        guarantees defined for any traffic.
        <br/>
        Not Required.
- **qos_mode** (String) Defines how QoS is applied to the link on this interface.<br/>
        If Full QoS or DSCP Handling and Throttling is selected as

        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the
        value for Allowed SYNs per Second is 10000, the Burst Size must be at least 1000.</li>

        purposes on any of the network interfaces.
        <br>
        <b>Required.</b>
- **sync_mode** (String) Defines how the nodes exchange information about the traffic that they
        process:
        <ul>
        <li><code>sync_all</code>: (recommended) Both full and incremental synchronization messages are
        sent. This allows frequent updates without consuming resources excessively.
        Regular full synchronization ensures that all nodes stay synchronized even if
        some incremental messages are not delivered.</li>
        <li><code>sync_full</code>: (not recommended) Only full synchronization messages are sent.
        Incremental updates are not sent in between, so nodes may not have the
        same information on connections unless the full sync interval is significantly
        reduced.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Note!</b> We strongly recommend using Access rule options to disable state
        synchronization for specific traffic rather than adjusting the State Sync
        settings for the cluster.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Required.</b>
- **sync_security** (String) The Synchronization Security Level:
        <ul>
        <li><code>none</code>: no security features. Do not select this options unless the heartbeat
        traffic uses a dedicated, secure network that does not handle other traffic.
        </li>
        <li><code>sign</code>: (default) transmissions are authenticated to prevent outside injections
        of connection state information.
        </li>
        <li><code>encrypt</code>: transmissions are authenticated and encrypted. This
        option increases the overhead compared to the default option, but is strongly
        recommended if the node-to-node communications are relayed through
        insecure networks (for example, if the backup heartbeat is configured on an
        interface that handles other traffic).
        </li>

entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the

        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you

generated Antispoofing and Discard log entry is logged separately and displayed as a separate
entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the
generated Antispoofing log entries or Discard log entries. After this, logging returns to normal
and all the generated entries are once more logged and displayed separately. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--vpn_broker_interface--log_moderation))

        automatically applied to any VLANs created under this
        Physical Interface.<br/>
        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you
        defined. This happens even if there are no bandwidth limits or
        guarantees defined for any traffic.
        <br/>

        number of Allowed SYNs per Second (the number of allowed SYN packets per second)
        and the Burst Size (the number of allowed SYNs before the engine starts limiting the
        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the

generated Antispoofing and Discard log entry is logged separately and displayed as a separate
entry in the Logs view. Log Compression allows you to define the maximum number of
separately logged entries. When the defined limit is reached, a single Antispoofing log entry or
Discard log entry is logged. The single entry contains information on the total number of the
generated Antispoofing log entries or Discard log entries. After this, logging returns to normal

        The throughput is for uplink speed (outgoing traffic) and
        typically must correspond to the speed of an Internet link
        (such as an ADSL line), or the combined speeds of several
        such links when they are connected to a single interface.<br/>
        <b>Caution!</b> Make sure you set the interface speed correctly.
        When the bandwidth is set, the Firewall always scales the
        total amount of traffic on this interface to the bandwidth you
        defined. This happens even if there are no bandwidth limits or
        guarantees defined for any traffic.
        <br/>

        number of Allowed SYNs per Second (the number of allowed SYN packets per second)
        and the Burst Size (the number of allowed SYNs before the engine starts limiting the
        SYN rate) for the interface based on the engineâs capacity and memory size.</li>
        <li><code>custom</code>: Enter the desired values for Allowed SYNs per Second and Burst Size. We
        recommend that the Burst Size be at least one tenth of the Allowed SYNs per Second
        value. If the Burst Size is too small, SYN Rate Limits do not work.<br/>For example, if the
        value for Allowed SYNs per Second is 10000, the Burst Size must be at least 1000.</li>

Optional:

- **address** (String)
- **comment** (String) Comment of the element.<br>
        Not required.
- **failure_mode** (String) Select how traffic to the Inline Interface is handled if the IPS engine goes offline.
        There are two options:
        <ul>
        <li><code>bypass</code>: traffic is allowed through the Inline Interface without inspection.</li>
        <li><code>normal</code>: traffic is not allowed through the Inline Interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Caution!</b> Using the Bypass mode requires the IPS appliance to have a fail-open
        network interface card. If the ports that represent the pair of Inline Interfaces on the
        appliance cannot fail open, the policy installation fails on the IPS engine.
